3. my work
using c++ to complete a small demo for assigning clients to different hospitals according to hosptials' occupancies and distance between them. Using UDP socket to communicate between scheduler and hospital, while using TCP socket to communicate between scheduler and clients. In this assignment, I code socket in c++, find the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm, struggle with some logic problems, use makefile and linux commands and so on.

4.  code files
scheduler.cpp: interacting with the client and the hospitals
client.cpp: request to go to a hospital
hospitalA.cpp/ hospitalB.cpp/ hospitalC.cpp: calculate the score
datatype.hpp: data type used when communicating through socket
map.hpp: create map and find the shortest distance for all hospital 
Makefile: create 5 executable files

5 format of all the messages exchanged
char buffer[64]
